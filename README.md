# Trees



# tree_traversals.cpp
The Binary Search Tree is a simple kind of tree that stores numbers in a way that keeps them sorted. When a new value is added, the program checks if it should go to the left or right side by comparing it with the current node.
I made functions to insert values, search for a number, delete nodes, and print the tree using inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals. 
The inorder one shows the numbers in order from smallest to biggest. I also added functions to find the smallest and largest values.
Making this helped me understand how data can be organized efficiently for searching.


# Avl.cpp
The AVL Tree is like an upgraded version of the BST that keeps itself balanced. 
Every time a new number is added or one is removed, the program checks if one side of the tree got taller than the other. 
If itâ€™s not balanced, it automatically rotates parts of the tree to fix it. I learned that there are four types of rotations (left, right, left-right, and right-left), and they make sure the height of the tree stays small. 
Because of this, the AVL Tree can search and insert faster than a normal BST even when you add many values.
